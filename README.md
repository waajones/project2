The decoding part works without any issues, however I am having a very hard time getting the simulation to work identically. For the most part I can get everything to match, but I cant get the simulation to stop exactly the right cycle. But all the data and registers should be identical and most of the cycles are identically. There are just a few that are not and I cant figure out why I cant fix it.
